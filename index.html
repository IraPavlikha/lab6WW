            <p>is an American artist of Ukrainian origin, one of the most outstanding sculptors of the 20th century. Her unique works, created mainly from wood, have become icons of modern art. She was born in the city of Przemyślany, which at that time was part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. In 1905, her family emigrated to the United States, where Louise later received an art education.</p>
            <p>Nevelson is best known for her monumental assemblages – three-dimensional compositions of assembled wooden objects painted in monochrome shades, mostly black, white or gold. Her works are characterized by multi-layeredness, texture and dramatic play of light and shadow. Among the most famous works is "Sky Cathedral".</p>
            <p>Louise Nevelson became a pioneer in the world of sculpture, changing the perception of materials and forms. Today, her works adorn museums and galleries around the world, and her contribution to the development of art cannot be overestimated.</p>
